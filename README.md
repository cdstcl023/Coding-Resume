# Coding-Resume
This project was to make a function that would pull data from the English Premier League's website based on the season entered as the first variable, and would only 
show the results up to the date that was specified in the function as the second variable. We then had to manipulate the data on from the website to provide custom 
statistics that are derivatives of the ones originally listed. This was a very fun project, and I enjoyed the trial and error while navigating through the work. There's
definitely room for improvement with the efficiency, but I felt good about getting it to work. It's like building your own go-cart out of scrap wood and an old lawnmower
motor, and it actually starts and runs, it's not pretty but your creation lives.
